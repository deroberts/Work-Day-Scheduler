# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
This is a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the work day (9AM-5PM). The application will display the current day and time, and will color code the text area for each hour to indicate whether the hour is in the past, present, or future. The user can input text into the text area for each hour, and can save the text by clicking the save button. If the user reloads the website or shuts down their browser, the text will still be visible.
